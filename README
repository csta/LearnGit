Git Dictionary for me, by me.

Gettin' started with mkdir, and git init.

$mkdir DIRNAME
$cd DIRNAME
$git init

$git add README
$git commit -m 'first commit'

set remote repo from CLI
$curl -u 'csta' https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"LearnGit"}'
$git push origin master

To create a branch
$git branch <name-of-branch>
In order to pointer to head to a different branch,
$git checkout <name-of-branch>

In order to see the difference between two branches,
$git diff <branch-1> <branch-2>
